                        <p>
                            At Accenture, I gained extensive experience working with various technologies across diverse
                            projects and roles. Collaborating within both local and multi-country teams, my primary area
                            of expertise focused on end-to-end data migrations and robust database development.
                            Throughout my career, I successfully utilized source control, DevOps methodologies, and AWS
                            services, while also leveraging provisioning tools such as Ansible, Terraform, and
                            CloudFormation. Additionally, I possess proficiency in Linux/Windows scripting. <br> <br>
                            Within the realm of database development, I am well-versed in essential components including
                            procedures, triggers, packages, functions, partitions, jobs, collections, and performance
                            tuning. I have consistently demonstrated my expertise in these areas. For further details

                            In my role as a System Administrator at a pension and life insurance company, I assumed
                            responsibility for various key tasks. This included the administration of Windows servers,
                            ensuring their smooth operation, and managing software and hardware installations.
                            Additionally, I took charge of maintaining the active directory users, performing regular
                            backups, and providing reliable end-user support. <br><br>
                            To further expand my skill set in SQL, I proactively developed ad-hoc reports for the
                            management team, enhancing their decision-making processes. Moreover, I actively engaged in
                            effective communication with sub-contractors, fostering productive collaborations. <br><br>
                            Overall, my tenure as a System Administrator encompassed a diverse range of

                            support, SQL reporting, and effective contractor coordination.

                            I actively participated in a project involving manual OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
                            for documents. In this initiative, I contributed to the digitization process by manually
                            extracting and transcribing text from physical documents, ensuring accurate and reliable

                                The aim of this project was to develop a predictive maintenance solution for electrical poles in a US energy company. The primary goal was to leverage advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques to predict potential damages on electrical poles. By implementing this predictive maintenance solution, the project aimed to proactively identify poles at risk of failure or damage, enabling the energy company to take preventive measures and avoid costly service disruptions. <br><br>

                                In my responsibilities I extended Aurora PostgreSQL (serverless v1) and AWS Athena, specializing in data
                                modeling and integration. Additionally, I have actively contributed to DevOps changes,
                                including Infrastructure-as-Code (IaaC) modifications using CloudFormation. <br><br>

                                Moreover, I have played a significant role in the merge request review process,
                                particularly for database and backend-related changes. My involvement in these reviews
                                ensures the quality and integrity of the codebase, facilitating seamless collaboration
                                and efficient project delivery. <br><br>

                                Throughout the project, I took the initiative to design and implement several changes
                                that significantly enhanced the team's efficiency during deployments to higher
                                environments. By introducing streamlined processes and optimizing configurations, I
                                effectively reduced deployment time and improved overall productivity. <br><br>

                                Furthermore, I undertook the responsibility of consolidating databases, resulting in
                                substantial cost savings. By merging multiple Serverless database clusters into one
                                shared cluster, I successfully minimized monthly expenses by several hundred dollars.
                                It's worth noting that while consolidation was implemented, individual developers'
                                databases remained isolated, ensuring data integrity and privacy. <br><br>

                                My contributions in designing efficiency-driven changes and executing cost-saving
                                measures demonstrate my ability to identify and implement practical solutions for
                                process improvement and resource optimization.

                                The aim of this project was to upgrade the existing Oracle database from version 11g to 19c, while concurrently migrating the platform from Unix to Linux, for the European Union Agency. The project was conducted in close collaboration with Oracle consultants to ensure a seamless transition. <br><br>

                                In my role, I took on the crucial responsibilities of database installation,
                                configuration, and upgrade, as well as data migration preparation. Specifically, I
                                focused on offline migration preparation utilizing data pump export and import methods.
                                Meanwhile, the Oracle consultants on the project were entrusted with handling real-time
                                replication using Golden Gate. <br><br>

                                By effectively managing the offline migration preparation, I contributed to the overall
                                success of the project. This collaborative approach allowed for a comprehensive data
                                migration strategy, combining the strengths of both offline and real-time replication
                                methods. <br><br>

                                My expertise in database installation, configuration, upgrade, and data migration
                                preparation, coupled with the collaborative engagement with Oracle consultants, resulted
                                in a well-executed and efficient data migration process.

                                The aim of this project was to migrate data from legacy systems into a new solution. The primary objective was to ensure a smooth and successful transition of data from the outdated and disparate legacy systems to a modern, consolidated solution. Multiple vendors responsible for target systems were involved. <br> <br>

                                As the Migration Technical Lead, I held a key role in the project, responsible for
                                overseeing the data migration architecture, defining the strategy, and determining the
                                approach for the migration process. This involved analyzing the existing systems,
                                identifying migration requirements, and designing a comprehensive plan to ensure a
                                successful migration. <br><br>

                                In addition to the strategic aspects, I actively participated in the standard tasks
                                associated with data migration. This included designing migration workflows, building
                                the necessary infrastructure, conducting thorough testing, and providing ongoing support
                                to ensure a smooth transition. <br><br>

                                Furthermore, as a team leader, I managed and coordinated the activities of the migration
                                team. This involved assigning tasks, monitoring progress, and providing guidance and
                                support to team members to ensure efficient and collaborative work. <br><br>

                                By assuming these responsibilities, I contributed to the overall success of the data
                                migration project. My expertise in data migration architecture, strategy development,
                                and team management enabled the seamless execution of the migration process while
                                ensuring adherence to quality standards. <br><br>

                                Migration involved complex data transformations from approximately 15 legacy systems,
                                including BSCS, Clarify, and the Data Warehouse. To facilitate this process, we utilized
                                a custom-built migration framework developed in PL/SQL, which included additional custom
                                modules specifically tailored for the client's needs. <br><br>

                                This in-house migration framework served as an ETL orchestrator, providing parallel
                                execution capabilities to optimize performance. We adopted a phased approach for
                                migrating B2C customers, with four migrations per month spread over two months. For B2B
                                customers, a long-term migration plan was implemented based on an input list. <br><br>

                                To streamline the deployment and release process for database changes, I took the
                                initiative to create a simple yet effective tool using PowerShell and CSV configuration.
                                This tool automated the preparation of deployment packages, enabling smoother and more
                                efficient database changes for production environment.

                                I took responsibility for developing smaller data migrations to facilitate data updates
                                in BSS (Business Support Systems) systems. <br><br>

                                These smaller data migrations were designed to handle specific data updates within the
                                BSS systems. Using my expertise in data manipulation and scripting languages such as
                                SQL, I developed scripts and queries to process data in a targeted manner. <br><br>

                                These migrations were executed as needed, ensuring that the data remained up to date and
                                aligned with the business requirements.

                                The aim of this project was to implement Salesforce.com, a leading customer relationship management (CRM) platform, in multiple countries.<br><br>

                                As part of the data migration team, I collaborated to develop a reusable framework for
                                data migration, which was utilized by each country involved in the project. This
                                framework was built using Microsoft T-SQL and driven by PowerShell scripts, enabling
                                efficient data cleansing, transformation, and loading processes into the Salesforce
                                platform. <br><br>

                                The framework provided a standardized approach to data migration, ensuring consistency
                                and reliability across multiple countries. It leveraged the power of T-SQL to perform
                                data manipulation tasks, such as data cleansing and transformation, to align the data
                                with the requirements of the Salesforce platform. <br> <br>

                                The PowerShell scripts acted as the orchestrator, coordinating the execution of various
                                migration steps, invoking the T-SQL scripts, and handling the necessary data loading
                                processes. This automation streamlined the data migration workflow and reduced manual
                                effort, enhancing overall efficiency. <br><br>

                                The reusability of the framework allowed each country to leverage the established best
                                practices and standardized processes, accelerating the data migration process while
                                maintaining data integrity and quality. <br><br>

                                Additionally, we leveraged the user-friendly interface of MS Excel for migration
                                progress monitoring. We developed a graphical user interface (GUI) using MS Excel,
                                allowing stakeholders to track the progress of the migration in a visually intuitive
                                manner. This provided transparency and real-time visibility into the migration process. <br><br>

                                By combining the parallel execution capabilities of MS SQL, PowerShell integration with
                                Salesforce data loader, and progress monitoring via MS Excel, we created a comprehensive
                                migration framework that ensured efficient data migration, seamless integration, and
                                effective progress monitoring. <br><br>

                                The integration of these technologies streamlined the migration process, improved
                                efficiency, and provided clear insights into the migration progress for stakeholders.
                                The collaborative efforts in designing and implementing this framework resulted in a
                                successful migration project, enabling a smooth transition of data into the Salesforce
                                platform.

                                The aim of this project was to take over the implementation of a solution from a vendor who was unable to deliver the project on time, within budget, and with sufficient quality. The primary objective was to rescue the project, bring it back on track, and ensure its successful completion. <br><br>

                                As a key contributor to the project, I played a vital role in shaping the solution,
                                defining the data migration strategy, and outlining the approach for daily batch
                                integration using the Siebel EIM (Enterprise Integration Manager) component. <br><br>

                                Furthermore, I collaborated closely with stakeholders to gather their input and ensure
                                that the solution aligned with their needs and expectations. Regular communication and
                                feedback loops were established to fine-tune the solution and address any emerging
                                challenges. <br><br>

                                We successfully executed a big-bang data migration approach, migrating
                                over 90 million records within a tight time frame of 48 hours. To achieve this, we
                                utilized an in-house built PL/SQL framework, originally created for another project,
                                which served as an ETL orchestrator with parallel execution capabilities. <br><br>

                                The framework efficiently coordinated and managed the data migration process,
                                orchestrating the extraction, transformation, and loading tasks in parallel to expedite
                                the overall migration timeline. We leveraged the scheduling capabilities of Oracle's
                                dbms_job to ensure optimized task execution and timely completion. <br><br>

                                To maintain data isolation and integrity, we employed Oracle's virtual private database
                                (VPD) feature within the framework. This allowed us to enforce data segregation and
                                access controls, ensuring that each set of data remained isolated and secure during the
                                migration process. <br><br>

                                This approach demonstrated our ability to optimize performance, manage large-scale data
                                migrations, and ensure secure data handling during the migration process. The successful
                                execution of the migration project showcased our expertise in leveraging in-house tools
                                and Oracle database features to deliver efficient and reliable data migration solutions.

                                The aim of this project was to upgrade the existing Siebel CRM system from version 6.3 to 8.1.9. However, due to the high level of customization present in Siebel 6.3, it was determined that a re-implementation approach would be more suitable. The project was conducted in a multi-vendor environment, involving collaboration and coordination among different vendors. <br><br>

                                In this project, we took on the responsibility of extracting and transforming data from
                                the Siebel 6.3 system and providing it to the vendor responsible for implementing the
                                new solution. <br><br>

                                To accomplish this, we conducted a thorough analysis of the data structures and business
                                requirements within the Siebel system. Leveraging my expertise in data extraction and
                                transformation, I developed an efficient process to extract the necessary data from
                                Siebel 6.3. Next, we applied appropriate transformations to align the data with the
                                format and requirements of the vendor's new solution. This involved data mapping,
                                cleansing, and restructuring to ensure seamless integration and compatibility with the
                                new system.

                                In this project, I was involved in various crucial aspects of the data migration
                                initiative. I played a pivotal role in gathering functional requirements from
                                stakeholders, ensuring a clear understanding of their needs and expectations. Based on
                                these requirements, I designed a robust data migration process that encompassed data
                                mapping, transformation rules, and data integrity measures. <br><br>

                                To support the migration, I developed a custom data migration framework tailored to the
                                project's unique needs. This framework automated data extraction, transformation, and
                                loading tasks, ensuring consistency and accuracy throughout the process. Rigorous
                                testing was conducted to validate the framework and ensure the quality of the migrated
                                data. <br><br>

                                During the data migration release, I provided on-site support, assisting the team in
                                executing the migration plan and addressing any challenges in real-time. Additionally, I
                                acted as a subject matter expert, providing guidance, coaching, and knowledge transfer
                                to team members who had limited experience in Siebel and data migration. <br><br>

                                By taking on these responsibilities, I ensured a seamless and successful data migration,
                                empowering the team and delivering high-quality results. <br><br>

                                To facilitate the migration process, we developed a custom PL/SQL framework with phased
                                and parallel capabilities. This framework enabled us to execute the extraction,
                                validation, transformation, and load phases concurrently, optimizing efficiency and
                                reducing overall migration time. <br><br>

                                While the framework allowed parallel execution, it followed a phased or waterfall
                                approach, ensuring that only one phase type was active at a given time. For example, if
                                the extraction phase for batch 1 was still in progress, the extraction phase for batch 2
                                would not start until the previous extraction was completed. It ensured that each phase
                                was executed successfully and completed before moving on to the next batch. <br><br>

                                By utilizing this custom PL/SQL framework with phased and parallel capabilities, we
                                achieved a balance between parallel processing and data integrity, resulting in a
                                streamlined and reliable migration process. The framework allowed for efficient
                                execution of each phase while maintaining the necessary dependencies and controls
                                between batches.

                                The aim of this project was to provide maintenance and support for Business Support Systems (BSS) and implement new change requests. As a senior member of the Siebel team, my responsibility was focused on data migration tasks, specifically addressing mass data changes in the CRM and Billing systems. <br><br>

                                Throughout the project, I played a significant role in multiple stages of the solution
                                implementation. This encompassed solution requirements gathering, design, development in
                                PL/SQL, migration testing, reporting, deployment, performance tuning, and execution
                                support. <br> <br>

                                During the requirements gathering phase, I actively engaged with stakeholders to
                                understand their needs and expectations. Through interviews, workshops, and analysis of
                                documentation, I gathered comprehensive requirements to guide the solution development
                                process. <br><br>

                                Based on the requirements, I proceeded with designing the solution. This involved
                                creating the architecture, determining the data flow, and identifying integration
                                points. The design phase focused on scalability, performance, and ensuring alignment
                                with the stakeholders' objectives. <br><br>

                                During the execution phase, I provided ongoing support, troubleshooting any issues, and
                                ensuring the solution operated as intended. I worked closely with stakeholders,
                                addressing their concerns and making necessary adjustments to meet evolving
                                requirements.
